# Scaling AI Networks with ArangoDB and Node Enterprise

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build and scale AI networks by connecting specialized machine learning models using ArangoDB and Node Enterprise. The notebook serves as a practical guide for integrating multi-model databases with dynamic node-based architectures to create robust and scalable AI pipelines.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Model Integration:** Learn how to encapsulate machine learning models as nodes and link them to create flexible AI networks.
- **Multi-Model Data Management:** Discover how ArangoDB's support for documents, graphs, and key-value storage can be leveraged to manage complex data relationships and model metadata.
- **Enhanced System Reliability:** Explore methods to reduce model hallucinations, lower computation costs, and improve overall system reliability by using a mixture of expert models.
- **Real-World Application:** Review an example inspired by the Penrose Care platform, illustrating how specialized models can be connected to deliver preventive care insights using digital twins.
